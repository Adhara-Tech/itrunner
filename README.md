Roadmap
-------
NOTE: a component must be created in jira and all these elements must be moved there OR use github issues as we are planning to opensource it
* Multiple ports exposed as part of a dependency (containers and pre provisioned services)
* Support for pre provisioned services
* Fine-grained control to shut down dependencies (now only after a group). Options can be after a version or after a suite
* Redefine test executable (support for gotestsum)
* Labeling to discriminate tests to be executed
